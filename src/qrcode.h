@defgroup objdetect Object Detection

Haar Feature-based Cascade Classifier for Object Detection
----------------------------------------------------------

The object detector described below has been initially proposed by Paul Viola @cite Viola01 and
improved by Rainer Lienhart @cite Lienhart02 .

First, a classifier (namely a *cascade of boosted classifiers working with haar-like features*) is
trained with a few hundred sample views of a particular object (i.e., a face or a car), called
positive examples, that are scaled to the same size (say, 20x20), and negative examples - arbitrary
images of the same size.

After a classifier is trained, it can be applied to a region of interest (of the same size as used
during the training) in an input image. The classifier outputs a "1" if the region is likely to show
the object (i.e., face/car), and "0" otherwise. To search for the object in the whole image one can
move the search window across the image and check every location using the classifier. The
classifier is designed so that it can be easily "resized" in order to be able to find the objects of
interest at different sizes, which is more efficient than resizing the image itself. So, to find an
object of an unknown size in the image the scan procedure should be done several times at different
scales.

The word "cascade" in the classifier name means that the resultant classifier consists of several
simpler classifiers (*stages*) that are applied subsequently to a region of interest until at some
stage the candidate is rejected or all the stages are passed. The word "boosted" means that the
classifiers at every stage of the cascade are complex themselves and they are built out of basic
classifiers using one of four different boosting techniques (weighted voting). Currently Discrete
Adaboost, Real Adaboost, Gentle Adaboost and Logitboost are supported. The basic classifiers are
decision-tree classifiers with at least 2 leaves. Haar-like features are the input to the basic
classifiers, and are calculated as described below. The current algorithm uses the following
Haar-like features:

![image](pics/haarfeatures.png)

The feature used in a particular classifier is specified by its shape (1a, 2b etc.), position within
the region of interest and the scale (this scale is not the same as the scale used at the detection
stage, though these two scales are multiplied). For example, in the case of the third line feature
(2c) the response is calculated as the difference between the sum of image pixels under the
rectangle covering the whole feature (including the two white stripes and the black stripe in the
middle) and the sum of the image pixels under the black stripe multiplied by 3 in order to
compensate for the differences in the size of areas. The sums of pixel values over a rectangular
regions are calculated rapidly using integral images (see below and the integral description).

To see the object detector at work, have a look at the facedetect demo:
<https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/samples/cpp/dbt_face_detection.cpp>

The following reference is for the detection part only. There is a separate application called
opencv_traincascade that can train a cascade of boosted classifiers from a set of samples.

@note In the new C++ interface it is also possible to use LBP (local binary pattern) features in
addition to Haar-like features. .. [Viola01] Paul Viola and Michael J. Jones. Rapid Object Detection
